#UNDER CONSTRUCTION as I add to this repo

This Project is all about **Vanilla JavaScript**!

I've been in the world of development a *little over* 9 months!!
So I decided to create a little project to help others get their feet wet in basic **Vanilla JavaScript**.

This also helps me brush up on my own skills by going back to the *'beginning'*.

**Clone to get started**!

Each topic is a separate JavaScript File:

1. variables_and_dataTypes.js
2. operators_and_equality.js

To view each JavaScript file, switch out the <*script*> in **'index.html'** with the JavaScript file of *your* choice!
