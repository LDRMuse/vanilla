This Project is all about Vanilla JS!

I've been in the developer world a little over 9 months and decided to create a little project to help others get their feet wet in basic, Vanilla JavaScript

Clone to get started!

Each topic is a separate JavaScript File:

1. variables_and_dataTypes.js
2. operators_and_equality.js

To view each JavaScript file, switch out the <*script*> in 'index.html' with the JS file of your choice!
